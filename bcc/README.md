# 🎓 BCC — Computer Science

This folder contains exercises developed during my **Bachelor of Computer Science** course.

🧠 You'll find here:

- Assignments from subjects like Programming Logic, Data Structures, Algorithms, etc.
- Code from classwork, lab sessions, and academic projects
- A mix of beginner, intermediate, and advanced exercises as the course progresses

> This is part of my academic journey. Some code is raw, others refined — all are part of the learning process 🚀
