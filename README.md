# 🧪 exercises-sandbox

Welcome to my **Exercises Sandbox** — a personal lab where I experiment with programming concepts, solve challenges, and practice algorithms across multiple languages.

This repository is not about perfection — it's about learning, breaking things, improving, and growing as a developer 🚀

## 🧠 What’s Inside?

A constantly evolving collection of:

- 📚 **Algorithmic exercises** (sorting, recursion, search, etc.)
- 🧩 **Data structures** (arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs)
- ⚙️ **Language practice** in Python, C++, JavaScript, and more
- 🔬 **Experimental snippets** and exploratory coding
- 📂 **Solutions to coding challenges** from various platforms

> This repo reflects my journey — you'll find rough ideas, improved solutions, and notes-to-self.
